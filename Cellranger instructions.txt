Instructions for cellRanger on the Imaris computer

Go to "Oracle VM Virtual Box"
Select Ubuntu Desktop SC
	Settings > System > Processor, set to 8 or more CPU
	When you are done, reset this to lower so that the rest of the computer runs faster
Open Ubuntu Desktop SC
Open code for cellranger, run the last line only (cellranger testrun --id=tiny) in terminal
Put your data in a folder on Ubuntu Desktop SC. You will need to put it in 
	sf_shared folder to move it onto the desktop of the virtual machine. 
Now open "cellrangeractualcommands" and edit the folder names so that they correspond
	to your actual folders with your data in them. Once they do, copy this file into the 
	folder containing your data. 
From the terminal, cd into your folder (should end in data_outs), then run 
	bash cellrangeractualcommands 
To get your data afterward, you need to move it temporarily into the shared folder. 
If the screen goes black and you cannot see the virtual box, try pressing home (F1) or home and right ctrl. 

Shut down the virtual box when done.
